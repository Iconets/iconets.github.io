    <h1 class="header-name">About Me</h1>

    <p style="text-align: justify;">
      I am <strong>Christian Onyeoziri</strong>, Head of the Vocational and Technical
      Department at <a href="https://innov8hub.ng/" target="_blank">
        <span style="color: rgb(10, 93, 128);">Innov8 Hub</span>
      </a>, a leading innovation and technology development center.
      With over a decade of experience in manufacturing, fabrication, and
      production systems, I specialize in CNC machining, CAM programming,
      precision fabrication, and industrial automation.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align: justify;">
      My core expertise lies in bridging the gap between conceptual design
      and production-ready systems. I focus on transforming functional
      prototypes into scalable, manufacturable products through rigorous
      engineering analysis, process optimization, and sound production
      planning practices.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align: justify;">
      In my role, I oversee the design and delivery of comprehensive
      hands-on technical training programs while coordinating fabrication
      initiatives that integrate engineering fundamentals with industrial
      best practices. I am responsible for ensuring that production
      workflows are optimized for efficiency, reliability, and scalability
      across diverse manufacturing environments.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align: justify;">
      My approach to engineering is rooted in the belief that technology
      must address tangible real-world challenges while simultaneously
      building sustainable technical capacity within organizations and
      communities. I place strong emphasis on practical problem-solving,
      system reliability, and long-term manufacturability.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align: justify;">
      Throughout my career, I have contributed to the development of over
      <strong>250 functional prototypes</strong> and <strong>eight Minimum
      Viable Products (MVPs)</strong>, supporting the full product lifecycle
      from innovation and proof-of-concept through to commercialization
      and manufacturing deployment. My work consistently emphasizes
      process rigor, technical excellence, and the practical application
      of advanced manufacturing technologies.
